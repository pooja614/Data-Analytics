### About the Data 

The data consists of the following fields:
* Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
* Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
* Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
* Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents 

### Steps 
* Overall analysis, account insights, demographic insights, internet service insights and churn trends are visualized using PowerBI.
