## Customer Churn Analytics
 - Churn analytics helps to detect product friction points and understand the reasons behind churn.
 - Churn analysis helps to understand the focus area for improvement:
    - Customer onboarding
    - Product usability.
- Here are the most common reasons why customers stop paying for your product, according to the Zopka study:<br>
    - <b>Poor Onboarding:</b> Poor and non-personalized product tours and GUI issues and popups.  
    - <b>Poor customer service:</b> Timely customer support, in-app help centers are important. 
    - <b>Unfullfilled Expectations:</b> Apt description of the product resembling actual functionality. 
    - <b>High Pricing:</b> Aligning pricing line to the market and product features offered is crucial. <br>


Taking proactive measures towards preventing churn will ensure growth of the business.
